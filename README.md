# Services for ISP

Webapp which automates common tasks for a common ISP

It includes:

1) An online checker, which generates a report in PDF to detect failures in a cleint's connection. It connects to the Antenna, the router, and checks the traffic historical data. This has two tabs, the first one being the simplest/quick version, and the second one the full version of it.
2) An alarm for customers who have exceeded the quota for the month, sending a report each month.
3) Email signature creation. This automates the process to create a simple HTML signature for the company to use.
4) A web interface to a web-less VDSL DSLAM. Very handy in case you do not want to connect each time via SSH. Simply connect to the web and perform actions.
